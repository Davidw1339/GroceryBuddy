## Description
Trying to find the cheapest and most convenient places to buy your groceries can be hard. Often times this involves memorizing prices and sales at different stores, but by the end you may not know where you are losing or saving money. We intend to crowdsource this pricing information so that users can record the prices of specific groceries at each store via a mobile app. Then this information is aggregated and viewable by users to see where they should go shopping depending on the groceries they need to purchase. This is the basis for our application, “GroceryBuddy”.
